<h1 class="major">Crop Prediction</h1>
                  									<h3>Problem Statement</h3>
									<blockquote>In India, where 50% of the population relies on agriculture for their livelihood, soil quality plays a crucial role in determining crop success. Mismatched crops not only lead to poor yields but also degrade soil health over time. This degradation perpetuates a cycle of declining agricultural productivity.</blockquote>
																		<h3>Proposed Solution</h3>
									<blockquote>I have devised a solution to address this challenge by developing a platform that assesses soil condition and provides crop recommendations based on soil parameters such as nutrient content, moisture levels, and rainfall patterns. Leveraging a meticulously trained machine learning model, the solution ensures accurate crop suggestions. Moreover, it's cost-effective and easily accessible to users. </blockquote>
									<h3>Technical Stack Description</h3>
									<blockquote>After obtaining a comprehensive dataset from Kaggle, I have utilized the LightGBM classification model for training. Users interact with our model by providing soil parameters, including:
<br>
<li>N: Ratio of Nitrogen content in soil (kg/ha)</li>
<li>P: Ratio of Phosphorous content in soil (kg/ha)</li>
<li>K: Ratio of Potassium content in soil (kg/ha)</li>
<li>Temperature: Temperature in degrees Celsius</li>
<li>Humidity: Relative humidity in %</li>
<li>pH: pH value of the soil</li>
<li>Rainfall: Rainfall in mm</li>
These parameters are crucial for determining soil suitability for different crops. Our machine learning model processes these inputs and generates tailored crop recommendations instantly, ensuring users receive accurate guidance for their agricultural endeavors.</blockquote>
